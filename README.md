# 🌚 About On-Site-Weather-App 🌞 

This app was made using HTML, CSS, & JS. There is an API call used with openweathermap.org and use with moment.js. Once the weather app has been opened it will ask to use your current location to provide you with an updated weather breakdown for the week. Please be aware that if you decline or 'block' the location it will not provide you with a weather forecast for your location. The weather breaks down the current day forecast with humidity, pressure, wind speed, and the time frame for sunrise and sunset. It will also give you the current day, month, and time for your location. The location will show in the top right corner with coordinates below. If the screen is minimized, you will be able to scroll through the weekdays for review. If on desktop, then it will be displayed across the bottom without the scroll effect. Each day gives you a day and night temperature in Celsius format. Please enjoy
